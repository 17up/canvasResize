jQuery canvasResize Plugin
=============

The plugin for client side image resizing. It's capable with **iOS6**. 
It is under the MIT License and It requires "jquery.exif.js" to work which is also under the MPL License [http://www.nihilogic.dk/licenses/mpl-license.txt]

I fixed iOS6 Safari's image file rendering issue for large size image (over mega-pixel) using few functions from 
[ios-imagefile-megapixel](https://github.com/stomita/ios-imagefile-megapixel)
And fixed orientation issue by using edited 
[jQuery EXIF data plugin](http://blog.nihilogic.dk/2008/05/jquery-exif-data-plugin.html)
